CrewP: Creeping with Particles
******************************

CrewP is creeping with IO of computational electronic structure packages.

The scripts is accumulating with author's adapting to new packages and functions.

Warning:
========

    Coding fast, Creeping with IO slowly.

Most concerned packages
=======================

* `Quantum ESPRESSO <http://www.quantum-espresso.org>`_
* `VASP <https://www.vasp.at>`_
* `DFTB+ <https://www.dftbplus.org>`_
* `XCrySDen <http://www.xcrysden.org>`_

Epilogue
========


    Particles shuttling fast,

    that Gods' light never cast.

    We are creeping, 

    to know the universe is vast.
